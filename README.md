# CppLINQ
### Description
yet another implementation of LINQ for C++ (method syntax)  
In development...

### Todo List
- [ ] LINQ keyword
  - [x] from
  - [x] where
  - [x] select

  - [x] let (won't implement)
  - [x] in (won't implement)
  - [x] on (won't implement)
  - [x] equals (won't implement)
  - [x] by (won't implement)
  - [ ] ascending
  - [ ] decending
- [ ] IQueryable like interface implementation
  - [x] aggregate
  - [x] all
  - [x] any
